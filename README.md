Intuitive Lap Tracking Application

Our application is an innovative lap tracking application, developed in Kotlin. It is designed to provide a seamless experience for athletes, fitness enthusiasts, or anyone who wishes to maintain a detailed record of their tracks.

The application allows users to intuitively set the start location and legs of a track, and then run it. It provides comprehensive statistics for each race, including time, speed, and distance covered.

In addition to basic lap tracking, our application  offers several advanced features:

- **Race Statistics**: The application provides detailed stats for each race, allowing users to analyze their performance.
- **Comments**: Users can set comments for each race, providing a way to note strategies, conditions, or other important details.
- **Save Track**: Users can save the track for later, making it easy to repeat favorite routes or share them with others.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features a clean, intuitive interface that makes it easy to use, even for beginners.

## Getting Started

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Git
- Android Studio
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Android SDK
- An Android Emulator or a physical Android device

Once you have the prerequisites, follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cmpt-370.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd cmpt-370/LapTracker
    ```

3. **Open the project in Android Studio**
    ```bash
    studio .
    ```
    Note: This command assumes you have the `studio` command set up in your PATH. If not, open Android Studio and use the "Open an existing Android Studio project" option.

4. **Build the project**
    In Android Studio, you can build the project by clicking on `Build -> Make Project`, or by pressing the shortcut `Ctrl+F9`.

5. **Run the project**
    Connect your Android device or start your emulator, then in Android Studio, click on `Run -> Run 'app'`, or press the shortcut `Shift+F10`.

You may also run the app on an android device using the .sdk file.

1. **Download .sdk file to your android device**

2. **Locate and open the sdk file on your android device**
    If you have never ran an sdk file on your android phone there will be a popup asking you to enable permissions to do so.

3. **Click Install**

4. **Click Open**
    When it has finished installing a popup will come up asking if you want to open the app so click open.

5. **App Crashes**
    If the app ever crashes go to Settings->Apps->LapTracker->Storage->Clear data
    This ensures everything is reset properly and the app can run
